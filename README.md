## In this, we create an ai model based on given data to predict which branch's students have a greater examly score, 

However, as we have an accuracy of 0.3 in trying to predict a branch (For Example CSE or Gaming), we can say that the results are independent of the branch of the student, and that all progress is individual. 

Also, due to insufficient data, we cannot also make predicitons without the 10th or 12th standard marks of the students, so as to maybe try linear regression on it.
